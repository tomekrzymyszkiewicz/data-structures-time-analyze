# Data structures time analyze
Program that checks the time of operations on data structures such as:

- array
- list
- stack
- queue

---

## Using a program

Set properties in configuration file:

- choose file with example data and amount of data
- choose file when the results will be saved
- enter a series of task to test by the program
```
Task syntax

task number = structure, range start value, range stop value, step value, number of repeat

Example

1 = array 1 1000 2 10
2 = stack 5 200 5
3 = list 1 100000 100

```
Run the program and read the current information.

Then you are able to load results and analize them (e.g. in Excel).
